## Project Description
By analyzing a dataset on wine reviews and wine exports, this project aims to provide some insights on the wine industry, with a special focus on price vs quality in Spain. 

## Questions & Hypotheses
While looking for a subject to our project, we came accross a wine review dataset on Kaggle. Some questions came out of our mind such as:

- What makes a good wine ?
- Where is the most expensive wine from ?
- What is the country that export the most wines ?
- What is the consumption pattern of wine by country ?


## Dataset
- Dataset of wine reviews from 2017 available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews): Dataset with >100,000 wine reviews. For each review, the following variable are specified: country, rating, designation.
- Dataset of wine exports by country, obtained trough [web scraping](http://www.worldstopexports.com/wine-exports-country/): information on country, and value and growth of wine exports ($).


## Database
Our final database was obtaind by joining the two tables mentioned above by the common variable "country". 


## Workflow
- Choose project topic
- Questions about topic
- Plan project
- Data cleaning (most of the time!)
- Visualizations of the data
- Paper and presentation

## Organization
We used a Trello Board to organize our project keep track or our progress thourgh the week. 

The repository is composed of two jupyter notebook files, one for each of the datasets studied. In the folder "Paper" there is the final project report, as well as images from the visualizations and final Tableau file.
